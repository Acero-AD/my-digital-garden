# Welcome to My digital garden.

A digital garden is a place where you publicly or privately share you ideas and the process they go through.

Is similar to the Zettlekasten method.

In my case i will use:

🌱 Seeds: For idea/concept that is starting to grow
🌳 Trees: A more structured note where I will connect different ideas creating some branching.
🍑 Fruits: This will be finish work like articles, scripts...
